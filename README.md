Using the genoerous Aria Project as base to this one,

My goal is to create a website for private tutors to be able to handle their schedule by using Full Calendar app.
Also some of Aria's original functions are used and mine are added and adjusted on them to achieve the goal.


Administrator (the tutor himself) will be able to accept/decline new students. manage the schedule.
Students - will each can have their own schedule which they see on the home page based on their login information

Demonstration website:https://lcenter.vercel.app/

this is still a work in progress so please let me know what you think
