Using the genoerous Aria Project as base to this one,

My goal is to create a website for private tutors to be able to handle their schedule by using Full Calendar app.
Also some of Aria's original functions are used and mine are added and adjusted on them to achieve the goal.


Administrator (the tutor himself) will be able to accept/decline new students. manage the schedule.
Students - will each can have their own schedule which they see on the home page based on their login information
when all the students finish their schedule , the administrator than can go through it and lock the schedule for the upcoming week.

Exmaples:
Personal schedule:

Administrator panel:
(Accept/Reject user registration)
